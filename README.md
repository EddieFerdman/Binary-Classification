# Binary-Classification

This project was a take home assignment. The task was to create two models for a binary classification.

Two data files were provided, a training set and a test set.
Data: Training set consisted on 50,000 observations, 100 features, and one target variable. Test set included 10,000 observations and 100 features.

The two ML algorithms chosen were Logistic Regression and XGBoost.

The performance metric was AUC score.

Results: LogisticRegression - AUC score = 0.907
         XGBoost - AUC score = 0.984
